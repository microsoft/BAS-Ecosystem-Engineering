# Introduction

We are the Microsoft Industry Clouds Partner and Customer Growth Engineering team, which is part of Microsoft Industry Clouds Group. We work side by side with the teams responsible for our solutions such as the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, Microsoft Cloud for Retail, Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services and also dependent technologies such as  Dataverse, Power Platform, Azure API for FHIR, Healthcare bot service and more. Through our POCs and collaboration with our dev teams, we bring you these reference samples. As we work with customers, partners, and co-workers, we frequently come across requests for samples for end to end demos/implementations of our solutions. For example, how can I demonstrate the triage process and agent escalation scenario in Patient Portal Chat? These questions and scenarios then become the basis for our samples and code snippets. We generalize the design for greater suitability and impact. As you look through this repository, which will be updated over time, you will see some typical 'hello world' examples as well as more complex solutions. We conduct peer reviews to bring you the best practices for using the Microsoft technologies. We invite you to ask questions, make suggestions and share use cases which we might consider for future posts.
